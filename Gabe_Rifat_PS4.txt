#Rifat_API
#I developed two parts, one to know about the sub-breeds of different breeds and other is to explore the photos
# Rifat_1, exploring the sub-breeds of different breeds
# Install and import necessary items

 #Here you can explore thousands of photos of different dog breeds!!
 #First we install and import different items as per our requirement
